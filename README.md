# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Project

This project demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the Tesseract library and OpenCV in Python. It involves extracting text from images, processing them, and performing OCR to recognize the text content.

## Features

- Converts images containing text into machine-readable text.
- Preprocesses images to improve OCR accuracy.
- Supports multiple image formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)

## Installation

1. Install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install OpenCV using pip:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. Install Tesseract OCR. You can download and install it from the [official Tesseract OCR website](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
4. Install pytesseract using pip:

    ```
    pip install pytesseract
    ```

5. Install Matplotlib using pip:

    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OCR-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd OCR_basic
    ```

3. Open the IPython Notebook file `ocr_project.ipynb`:

    ```
    jupyter notebook OCR.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code.

5. The processed image will be displayed, and the extracted text will be printed in the notebook.
